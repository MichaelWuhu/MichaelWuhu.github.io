# Hello! 
Welcome to the source code of my website!

## To run locally:

### `npm install`
installs any dependencies

### `npm start`
Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

## Reminder for me to deploy XD:
### `npm run deploy`
Publishes the deploy to GH pages. You can also use `$ npm run deploy -- -m "Deploy React app to GitHub Pages"` to specify a commit message.
